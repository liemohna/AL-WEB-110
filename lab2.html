    <h1>The Top 10 Best Ways to Get to Know Someone</h1>
    
    <p>First day at the office and you just met your new colleagues? Ran into an old friend and want to catch up?  Just met a long-lost cousin? Here's the top 10 ways to spend a day with somebody.</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Go to a coffee shop!</li>
        <li>Walk the trails in a Michigan metropark.</li>
        <li>Play a sport: pick-up basketball, mini-golf, biking, etc.</li>
        <li>Cook a meal collaboratively.</li>
        <li>Find a place that has live music, whether indoor or outdoor, and spend time there.</li>
        <li>Do something creative together like a walk-in painting or pottery class in your town where each person gets to make something.</li>
        <li>Go to Sky Zone or Zap Zone to either jump around or play laser tag.</li>
        <li>Play a board game, card game, or video game that everyone enjoys.</li>
        <li>Spend a day at the beach.</li>
        <li>Walk around the mall or other crowded, urban areas and see what each other think of the new displays.</li>

    <h2>Definitions List</h2>
    
    <dl>
        <dt>Addresses</dt>
        <dd>Address tags allow for someone's contact info to be written out and seen as separate from other code. Using the address tags, the text within the tags is italicized and on its own line.</dd>
        
        <dt>Line Breaks</dt>
        <dd>Line break tags are a way to start a new line of text. They're often used around photos or images on a webpage so that the text around it is more readable.</dd>
        
        <dt>Inserted Tags</dt>
        <dd>Inserted Tags are a way to include an edit to a particular spot in the code---usually in order to indicate collaborator's credit on a coding project. They show a <q>cite</q> section and a <q>datetime</q> section as part of the tag.</dd>
        
        <dt>Deleted Tags</dt>
        <dd>Deleted Tags are a way to add a strikethrough to a section of text to show that it has been deleted. These tags also include a <q>datetime</q> section just like Inserted Tags.</dd>
        
        <dt>Subscripts</dt>
        <dd>Subscript tags are a way to allow the text within the tag to be in the form of a subscript. This is often used in mathematical equations or for footnotes.</dd>
