    <h1>An Adventure at Spider Lake</h1>
    
    <p>This past summer my family and I rented out a weekend at a cabin on Spider Lake. I had never heard of Spider Lake before this trip, but it is now one of my fondest memories. I also invited two of my closest friends, Erin and Lucia, to come along.
    
    <h2>The Journey to the Cabin</h2>
    
    <p>We had planned to leave around noon on a Friday, but after a few too many stops on our way North, by the time we reached the greater area of Forest Lakes it was around sundown. Navigating through the winding roads along jagged edge of the shoreline, our headlights weren't much help as we weaved around trees hoping not to hit any animals. Finally, we found our address and grabbed our flashlights as we approached the cabin.
    
    <h2>Days in the Sun</h2>
    
    <p>After successfully getting into our cabin that first night, fighting over who got the lower bunk and eventually settling on a fair arrangement, the next morning it was time to explore. Our cabin looked out onto Spider Lake unlike some of the cabins in the neighborhood, so we collectively decided to spend as much time there as we could soaking it in. One of the days we travelled into Traverse City, Michigan where there was a event happening downtown, but most of our time was spent out on Spider Lake.</p>
    
    <div>The water of the lake itself was also so clear we could see fish swimming in it. Just a few feet away from the dock there was also a collection of about a hundred lily pads. I don't think I'll ever get over that view---it was spectacular.</div>
    
    <h2>Reflections from the Lake</h2>
    
    <p>Leaving for this trip, I didn't know if I'd enjoy being on a small lake as much as I enjoyed being by the Great Lakes. However, Spider Lake proved me wrong. Even though the Great Lakes can offer experiences like climbing large sand dunes and hiking a shoreline for miles and miles, small lakes provide a sense of serenity and comfort in a cosy way that you can't find as much around the big lakes. This trip was a fun time, and I see myself going again sometime with whatever adventure buddy wants to come along with me.<br />-Annie Liemohn</p>
